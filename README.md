## Installation

To use this financial calculator locally, follow these steps:
<br>

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Finance_Calculator.git
   ```
   <br>
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Finance_Calculator
   ```
   <br>
   
3. Run the financial calculator script from terminal, choose either script depending on requirements:

   a. This script is the original codebase with comments:
   
   ```bash
   python finance_calculator.py
   ```
   <br>
   b. This script is an alternative version with more detailed comments explaining the code:
   
   This is to improve the learning process and for more clarity on why certain code was used.

   ```bash
   python finance_calculators_extra_comments.py
   ```
   <br>
   c. This script is just the code without any comments:

   ```bash
   python justcode.py
   ```
   <br>
  
4. You can refer to the pseudocode file as an outline of the logic of the program using human-readable, informal language,
   facilitating algorithm development and clearer communication between developers.
   <br>

## Usage

After installing the project, you can use it as follows:

1. Choose between 'investment' or 'bond' based on your financial calculation needs.

2. Enter the required information when prompted, such as the deposit amount, interest rate, investment period, house value, interest rate for a bond,
   and the number of months for bond repayment.

3. The program will calculate and display the total interest for an investment or the monthly repayment amount for a home loan.

### Main Program

This Python code represents a financial calculator program that provides users access to two distinct calculators:

   *1. An investment calculator*
   
   *2. A home loan repayment calculator*

1. The program incorporates while loops to continually prompt the user for numerical input, ensuring valid entries. Additionally, it defines a function, `obtain_numerical_input`, to handle repetitive input code. The user is presented with a welcoming introduction outlining the available calculators and their respective purposes, and the code employs the `math` module for mathematical operations.

<br>
<br>
2. This Python code implements a financial calculator program with a user interface that operates within a while loop. The program prompts the user to choose between an investment calculator, a home loan repayment calculator, or to stop calculations altogether. Depending on the user's choice, it further prompts for relevant inputs such as deposit amount, interest rate, and duration. The program calculates either the simple or compound interest for investments or the monthly bond repayment amount based on the user's input. It incorporates error handling for invalid entries and continues to execute until the user chooses to stop.
